    <h2>This a sentence using (h2) tag....</h2>
    <h3>This a sentence using (h3) tag....</h3>
    <h4>This a sentence using (h4) tag....</h4>
    <h5>This a sentence using (h5) tag....</h5>
    <h6>This a sentence using (h6) tag....</h6>
    
    <p>This is a paragraph that includes several HTML formatting elements which was given for us:
        <b>this one's bold text</b>, 
        <strong>this one's strong text</strong>, 
        <i>this is italic text</i>, 
        <em>we can also emphasized text</em>, 
        <mark>sometimes we need to highlight important text</mark>, 
        <small>we can make text smaller so that we want to use some magnifier</small>, 
        <del>and we can also show delete tag</del>, 
        <ins>this is insert text which will underline any text..</ins>, 
         we can express atomic symbols using sub tag just like H<sub>2</sub>O {subscript for lowering text} and E=mc<sup>2</sup> {superscript for uplifting any text}.
    </p>

   
    <p>Not only cars and other vehicles but also html can break!!!... <br>Here is a demo.... <br>tadaa!!! </p>
