        <h2>Here is the lyrics of one of my favourite songs:</h2>
        <p>
            Watching my <mark>friends</mark><br />
            I love how they're dancing in the dark<br />
            Driving, flying<br />
            Hanging with their heads out of the car<br /><br />

            [Pre-Chorus]<br />
            For the first time since last time<br />
            I've got something good that I don't wanna ruin<br />
            Between smoke breaks and mistakes<br />
            We say we do, but don't know what the hell we're doing<br /><br />

            [Chorus]<br />
            If I didn't have <mark>friends</mark>, I'd have no defense<br />
            Just let the world end<br />
            That's it, that's my armageddon<br />
            If I lose them and it's just me again<br />
            Just let the world end<br />
            That's it, that's my armageddon<br /><br />

            [Verse 2]<br />
            We could travel the state<br />
            Draw on our face, stitch on our heart<br />
            Paint a night that is new<br />
            But I'd be content wherever we are<br />
            See upcoming pop shows<br />
            Get tickets for your favorite artists<br />

            For the first time since last time<br />
